# World of Bugs Experiments

Experiments associated with the paper [Learning to Identify Perceptual Bugs in 3D Video Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12884). To train a model, use `__main__.py`, a model can be configured in `configuration/`, the default config file used is `config_AE.yaml`, this can be changed in `__main__.py`.

For more details see the [World of Bugs](https://github.com/BenedictWilkins/world-of-bugs) repository and our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12884).

## Experiments

We used [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/) to to manage our experiments, see [here](https://wandb.ai/benedict-wilkins/WOB-Experiments) for model and training details (note the only one run is currently available).

## Documentation

More documentation on getting set up with running experiments is coming soon.
